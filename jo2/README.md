<h2>The Magic Toaster</h2>

  My friends have this toaster oven that feels like it’s from some strange si-fi future. It has a screen on it and it can connect to the internet. The coolest thing about it though is that it can automatically detect what you put in it and then it will suggest several ways of cooking whatever it was you stuck inside. For example it can detect the difference between raisin bread and white bread. It can’t identify everything however as if you put a full plate in there it will either single one thing out or just not take a guess.


  We tried two things on different occasions. First white bread. Upon placing the bread in the oven the little screen pops up with a few pictures of what level of toasty I want the bread. I like extremely light toast so even the light toast setting was a little too crispy, but upon a second attempt I was able to learn the exact adjustment for what I wanted.



Occasion two was an attempt to use the oven to reheat some old food and this is where we just had to use the generic cook settings. This was probably a problem with the plate over the oven but upon removing the plate it was super hot, way too hot to touch. The food however was only lukewarm. Given that there is only so much you can do in the settings this didn’t feel like a solvable problem.  



 In conclusion, this oven is pretty neat. It can do a lot,  but not everything. Definitely a fun look onto the future of what cooking can be.
